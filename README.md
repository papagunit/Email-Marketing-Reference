# Everything you need to know about Email Marketing

###### From design to development, tools, and best practices.

This is still a work in progress, as there's just so much to talk about. Email Marketing is an undocumented rabbit hole...until now.

Let me know if you're interested in contributing. Some of this is original content off the top of my head, after doing this kind of work for a couple years, but it's impossible for me to know everything. Some of this is copied or adapted from various updated resources online and given credit where credit is due.

Q: Why are most of the pages empty?

A: They act as placeholders for future ideas I wish to expound. I only work on this in my spare time.
