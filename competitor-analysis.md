A dirty, untold trick within email marketing is competitor analysis. For you, the great thing about email is that it's easy to get onto someone's mailing list. Unless it's a very small business, truth be told, they won't know you're in the system, much less that you're a competitor[^1]. This makes it easy to see their current customer journey, what emails are being sent out and when, what changes when you continually interact with their emails and site, how often they reach out to you, their go to market strategy, the messaging used, and even how they code their emails.

[^1]: Some ESPs support blacklists, which can be automatically generated based on filters you implement, such as competitor's domain names. This way, the contact is kept in your system, but they won't receive any of your marketing messages and are effectively unsubscribed. However, they won't know that. To get around a blacklist, just use your personal email address or an anonymous one with a fake moniker.
