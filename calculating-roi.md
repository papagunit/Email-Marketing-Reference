If you are sending emails at a small scale with an inexpensive or even free service, the effort spent calculating ROI might not even be worth it. You could probably do the math in your head, or the costs might be so insignificant. However, for larger organizations who hire a dedicated email marketer, or multiple devs, coordinators, managers just for their email marketing efforts, and shell out tens to hundreds of thousands just on emails, then ROI really begins to matter. The idea solution is to know the cost per lead, cost per email, and the revenue attributable to each email sent. I say ideal because, it's not always easy to calculate these numbers, and requires all the right data to be tracked and come together.

Larger ESPs and CRMs provide tracking and even reporting solutions out of the box, so getting the data you need might not be difficult. I will not go into the specifics for each platform and how to implement an ROI \(or "Closed Loop Reporting"\) calculation, but the general steps outlined could be applied to your setup.



What costs do I take into account or factor in?
