# Email Campaign Development Process

Here I will try to outline a general series of steps that marketers should follow when designing, developing, and executing a marketing campaign, with the email channel as a main focus. Of course, this must be considered as a part within the whole marketing department, but this is what matters to those who are creating the emails. Following this process will reduce the mistakes made, keep the campaign completion date on track, and save time by gathering all requirements early.

## 1. Campaign Need Identification

Marketing listens closely to other business departments such as sales, to the customers, and trends happening throughout the world. One of these factors might cause someone in marketing to come up with a new campaign idea. Customers are complaining about a lack of onboarding process. Sales needs support to help qualify leads, or the messaging is inconsistent and leaving prospects confused. Perhaps there's a trend related to your industry or target market that you wish to capitalize on. Maybe a competitor's campaign inspired you, and now you want one. Whatever the reason is, it becomes the kernel for a new campaign. You identify the needs for a campaign that you wish to execute upon. If that campaign requires the use of the email channel, keep that idea in mind, and let's proceed to the next step.

## 2. Initial Strategy Discussion

If you're a team of one, you might have a brainstorming discussion with yourself where you write down different ideas of what you want to do. If you have others on your team, bring them together and gather their input and how they want to see the campaign executed. When do you want it done by? What channels should we be using? What is our budget? Do we have enough bandwidth to support this on top of our other priorities? How long will the development take? Will this be a brand new campaign, or an improvement on an existing campaign running today? Are there any potential legal complications? Should get gather feedback from sales? Who are all of the potential stakeholders?

As the discussions continue, the idea should move from an abstract concept to something more concrete. You're able to discretely demonstrate how many emails you will need, what you generally want them to say, what you want them to look like, who should receive them, and at what point in the customer journey they should receive them. How you facilitate these discussions is up to you and your team dynamic. Creativity is great, but be realistic and don't get lost on tangents that don't address the current needs. Every moment that goes by could mean a lost opportunity because you didn't execute on your campaign sooner!

## 3. Draft The Requirements \(Email Requirements Elicitation/ERE\)

[Requirements Elicitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_elicitation), or "requirements gathering" comes from the [software engineering](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Use-elicitation-techniques-to-discover-software-requirements) and [business analysis](http://www.modernanalyst.com/Resources/Articles/tabid/115/ID/1427/An-Overview-of-Requirements-Elicitation.aspx) world. However, the basic concepts apply well to email development. In marketing, because there are many ways to go about one campaign, it's important to understand exactly what the executives, customers, and your own team want to see. No, we don't need to have focus groups, surveys, workshops, or analysis \(if you have time for that great, but that should be part of your overall yearly marketing plan\). But what is important is that everyone is on the same page about what will be sent. To make the process go faster, and to reduce the need for additional meetings, it's important to get the following questions answered. In fact, I'll provide my own Word document that includes the following:

### General

* **Campaign Name** - for internal use
* **Campaign Start/Go Live** - What date and time should the campaign be executed on? This gives an idea for when the campaign development should be completed by.
* **Campaign End** - When should we stop sending emails? When should we stop collecting metrics on emails sent?
* **Completion Date** - When does the whole campaign need to be approved, tested, and completed by? Ideally a couple days before the Start date to give slack or wiggle room for unforeseen roadblocks.
* **Data needed** - ESP/MAPs today are very dependent upon data from the CRM for triggering, segmenting, and producing dynamic content. What contact fields are currently available in your ESP today, is it sufficient, and do you need additional data from your CRM or Business Intelligence team? Identifying this need early on can save time, because if the data is not available or reliable, that can halt the campaign as whole, or it can take time to add the field to your platform and do proper testing.
* **Idea behind campaign** - This goes back to step one and two. Why do we need it? What inspired it? How does it fit into our business processes?
* **Campaign goals** - In general, what do we want to see as a result of this campaign?
* **How will success be measured** - In the end, how will we determine if the campaign was a success? [What metrics will we look at](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/6-must-have-email-marketing-metrics), and what [KPIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) will we focus on?
* **Marketing, Transactional, or both** - Legally \(CAN-SPAM\), can the emails in this campaign be considered marketing or transactional? This will greatly influence the messaging and layout.
* **Hours/days needed to complete** - Give your best guess, but this can be difficult to measure initially. If you're using a project management software, this might be easier.
* **Call to actions** - What are we asking the end user to do? Give us a call, click a link, fill out a landing page, purchase a specific widget, etc.
* **Measurement of ROI** - How can we justify the costs of this campaign?
* **Potential roadblocks** - Off the bat, what concerns do you foresee that could impede the campaign? Let's address them now before we get too invested.
* **Target audience** - What brand is this campaign for? Customers or leads? Certain region?
* **Frequency \(One time, multiple batches, or continuous/triggered\)** - A campaign is typically one of these.
* **Time of day email can be sent** - Is there a specific time range in which users should receive these emails?
* **Number of unique emails to be created **- This helps estimate how much work will be involved.
* **Number of email templates used** - This might be useful for some. Gives you an idea of how much variation and dependencies there might be.
* **Number of new email templates needed** - Will this campaign require a completely new email design?
* **Use A/B Testing \(yes/no\)** - Should we A/B test any part of this campaign?
* **A/B Testing elements** - What specifically are we looking to test \(subject line, body content, template, time of day, day of week\)?
* **A/B Testing structure** - What percentage of the audience should receive this? What criteria determines a winner?
* **End A/B testing** - When do we wish to declare a winner? After what engagement level \(clicks, opens, form fills, purchases\) or time has passed?
* **Dynamic content or lookup tables** - Is there any dynamic content we wish to use and need to pre populate, or any lookup tables to import and test?
* **External assets used in conjunction** - Files, blog posts, landing pages?
* **Existing graphics used** - Do we already have stock images or icons in our library that will be used in these emails?
* **New graphics needed** - Do we need to find specific images or have a graphic created specifically for this campaign?
* **Amount of copy needed** - Rough estimate to gauge how much turnaround time to give copywriters.
* **Number of unique Toll Free Numbers needed**[^1] - How many different unique numbers do we need to have created?
* **Legal Approval \(yes/no/pending/not needed\)** - What's the current approval status from legal?
* **Copy stakeholders** - Who will be in charge of the copy and approval?
* **Data stakeholders** - Who will get us the data that we need? In particular for segmentation, triggering, and lookup tables.
* **Performance stakeholders** - Who is interested in how well this campaign performs? Usually managers and execs. List them here so you remember to CC them when you send out your report.
* **Graphic stakeholders** - Who will find the new graphics that you listed above?
* **Legal stakeholders** - Who needs to approve the campaign from a legal stance?
* **Other stakeholders** - Anyone else genuinely interested in this campaign for some other reason?

### Emails

I use the following template for each email in the campaign.

* **Email \#** - A simple number you can attribute to each email, so instead of referring to it by a long name, you go back to this document and say "look at email X".
* **Email Name** - Optional, if you want something less formal than the internal name.
* **Main Messages/Key Points to Convey **- What do we want the user to know after they have read the email?
* **Internal Name** - Descriptive internal name, usually what is used within the ESP. Best to follow some naming convention.
* **Email Group** - More [specific to Eloqua](http://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/index.html#Help/EmailGroups/Tasks/CreatingEmailGroups.htm), but what category does this email fit under? Probably the closest equivalent in [Marketo would be Workspaces](http://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+a+New+Workspace).
* **Template used **-
* **From Name** -
* **From Email **-
* **Subject Line** -
* **Pre Header **-

### Copy Elements

I use the following template for each unique piece of copy used throughout the campaign.

**Copy \#**

**Email/LP Used in** -

**Stakeholder Assigned To** -

**Thesis** -

**Length/Estimated Word Count** -

**Tone/Style** -

**Turnaround Time** -

**Deadline** -

**Content **-

### Graphic Elements

| Used in | Graphic file name |
| :--- | :--- |
|  |  |

### Segmentations

| \# | Name | Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |

### Landing Pages

| Name | Linked from | Content Elements used | Notable fields | Phone Number | Media Code | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Internal name | Where is this accessible from? \(SEM, email, website, etc\) | From the Copy section, which elements are used on this page | If page has a form, what fields should be on it? | If you have one, what phone number will be on this page? | Some type of unique tracking identifier | Link to the actual page |

### Phone Numbers

| Number | Used In | Media Code |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  |  |  |

### UTM/Tracking Parameters

Do you use any UTM or other tracking on your links from the email? Detail them here.

### Future Improvement Expectations

What ways do we wish to improve on this in the future? When do we want to revisit this campaign for improvement? Letting old campaigns go unchecked may result in conflicting messaging or continuing outdated business processes \(i.e. "We don't do that anymore!"\).

### Reports and Analysis, Outcomes, Performance Review - Post Production

What kind of reports need to be put together \(PPT, Excel, dashboard\)? What metrics/KPIs need to be included? When are they due? When are updates due? Who should the reports be prepared for?

### Flowchart

I love creating flowcharts to show to outside stakeholders, espeically in presentations. You can go as high level, or detailed as you want, present in a universal way that doesn't require the viewer to understand the ESP specific notations, and include any other outside interactions \(data sources, user behaviors, etc\).

### Competitor Analysis/Similar Campaign

Do you have screenshots of similar emails or landing pages that inspired you?

## 4. Distribution of ERE to Stakeholders

Let everyone involved know exactly what you will be working on. If they don't like what they see, it's best to bring it up now, than down the road when you've already spent weeks developing 10 emails, and it's not what they wanted at all. Put the document on a shared drive, or email it out so that everyone has a copy. Most might not read it, but at least you have it on record for when they put up a fight later.

## 5. Begin Project Management Time Tracking

## 6. Email Design/Layout/Wireframe

## 7. Email Design Approval

## 8. Email Development

## 9. Email Testing

## 10. Segment Creation

## 11. Campaign Flow Development

Most mature MAPs offer a drag and drop flowchart-like interface to design campaigns. At this point, you can put all the assets and logic together.

## 12. Campaign Flow Testing

## 13. Final Approval

## 14. Scheduling

## 15. Bug Watching

Sometimes mistakes aren't caught before execution, and your contacts are pointing it out. If there's time, go back and fix those mistakes! You might also see that no emails were sent, when they should have been. Platforms are known for having bugs once in awhile where the email just doesn't get sent. Unusual numbers in preliminary reporting can help you identify any issues.

## 16. Reporting

After your campaign has been running for enough time to get some significant data, or it has finished execution, it's time to look at what happened. Your company executives and manager will want to see this! Read this chapter for help on Reporting.

[^1]: I currently work for an organization where we track every call and attribute a specific number to each marketing channel and collateral. We can determine where the user found the phone number. Internally we would call them TFNs. Does your organization do this?
