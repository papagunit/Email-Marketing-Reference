# Email Campaign Development Process

Here I will try to outline a general series of steps that marketers should follow when designing, developing, and executing a marketing campaign, with the email channel as a main focus. Of course, this must be considered as a part within the whole marketing department, but this is what matters to those who are creating the emails. Following this process will reduce the mistakes made, keep the campaign completion date on track, and save time by gathering all requirements early.
