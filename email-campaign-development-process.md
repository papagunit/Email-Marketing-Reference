# Email Campaign Development Process

Here I will try to outline a general series of steps that marketers should follow when designing, developing, and executing a marketing campaign, with the email channel as a main focus. Of course, this must be considered as a part within the whole marketing department, but this is what matters to those who are creating the emails. Following this process will reduce the mistakes made, keep the campaign completion date on track, and save time by gathering all requirements early.

## 1. Campaign Need Identification

Marketing listens closely to other business departments such as sales, to the customers, and trends happening throughout the world. One of these factors might cause someone in marketing to come up with a new campaign idea. Customers are complaining about a lack of onboarding process. Sales needs support to help qualify leads, or the messaging is inconsistent and leaving prospects confused. Perhaps there's a trend related to your industry or target market that you wish to capitalize on. Maybe a competitor's campaign inspired you, and now you want one. Whatever the reason is, it becomes the kernel for a new campaign. You identify the needs for a campaign that you wish to execute upon. If that campaign requires the use of the email channel, keep that idea in mind, and let's proceed to the next step.

## 2. Initial Strategy Discussion

If you're a team of one, you might have a brainstorming discussion with yourself where you write down different ideas of what you want to do. If you have others on your team, bring them together and gather their input and how they want to see the campaign executed. When do you want it done by? What channels should we be using? What is our budget? Do we have enough bandwidth to support this on top of our other priorities? How long will the development take? Will this be a brand new campaign, or an improvement on an existing campaign running today? Are there any potential legal complications? Should get gather feedback from sales? Who are all of the potential stakeholders?

As the discussions continue, the idea should move from an abstract concept to something more concrete. You're able to discretely demonstrate how many emails you will need, what you generally want them to say, what you want them to look like, who should receive them, and at what point in the customer journey they should receive them. How you facilitate these discussions is up to you and your team dynamic. Creativity is great, but be realistic and don't get lost on tangents that don't address the current needs. Every moment that goes by could mean a lost opportunity because you didn't execute on your campaign sooner!

## 3. Draft The Requirements \(Email Requirements Elicitation/ERE\)

[Requirements Elicitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_elicitation), or "requirements gathering" comes from the [software engineering](http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/Use-elicitation-techniques-to-discover-software-requirements) and [business analysis](http://www.modernanalyst.com/Resources/Articles/tabid/115/ID/1427/An-Overview-of-Requirements-Elicitation.aspx) world. However, the basic concepts apply well to email development. In marketing, because there are many ways to go about one campaign, it's important to understand exactly what the executives, customers, and your own team want to see. No, we don't need to have focus groups, surveys, workshops, or analysis \(if you have time for that great, but that should be part of your overall yearly marketing plan\). But what is important is that everyone is on the same page about what will be sent. To make the process go faster, and to reduce the need for additional meetings, it's important to get the following questions answered. In fact, I'll provide my own Word document that includes the following:

#### General

* **Campaign Name** - for internal use
* **Campaign Start/Go Live** - What date and time should the campaign be executed on? This gives an idea for when the campaign development should be completed by.
* **Campaign End** - When should we stop sending emails? When should we stop collecting metrics on emails sent?
* **Completion Date** - When does the whole campaign need to be approved, tested, and completed by? Ideally a couple days before the Start date to give slack or wiggle room for unforeseen roadblocks.
* **Data needed** - ESP/MAPs today are very dependent upon data from the CRM for triggering, segmenting, and producing dynamic content. What contact fields are currently available in your ESP today, is it sufficient, and do you need additional data from your CRM or Business Intelligence team? Identifying this need early on can save time, because if the data is not available or reliable, that can halt the campaign as whole, or it can take time to add the field to your platform and do proper testing.
* **Idea behind campaign** - This goes back to step one and two. Why do we need it? What inspired it? How does it fit into our business processes?
* **Campaign goals** - In general, what do we want to see as a result of this campaign?
* **How will success be measured** - In the end, how will we determine if the campaign was a success? [What metrics will we look at](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/6-must-have-email-marketing-metrics), and what [KPIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) will we focus on?
* **Marketing, Transactional, or both** - Legally \(CAN-SPAM\), can the emails in this campaign be considered marketing or transactional? This will greatly influence the messaging and layout.
* **Hours/days needed to complete** - Give your best guess, but this can be difficult to measure initially. If you're using a project management software, this might be easier.
* **Call to actions** - What are we asking the end user to do? Give us a call, click a link, fill out a landing page, purchase a specific widget, etc.
* **Measurement of ROI** - How can we justify the costs of this campaign?
* **Potential roadblocks** - Off the bat, what concerns do you recognize that could impede the campaign? Let's address them now before we get too invested.

## 4. Distribution of ERE to Stakeholders

Let everyone involved know exactly what you will be working on. If they don't like what they see, it's best to bring it up now, than down the road when you've already spent weeks developing 10 emails, and it's not what they wanted at all. Put the document on a shared drive, or email it out so that everyone has a copy. Most might not read it, but at least you have it on record for when they put up a fight later.
