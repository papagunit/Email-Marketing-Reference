# Email Campaign Development Process

Here I will try to outline a general series of steps that marketers should follow when designing, developing, and executing a marketing campaign, with the email channel as a main focus. Of course, this must be considered as a part within the whole marketing department, but this is what matters to those who are creating the emails. Following this process will reduce the mistakes made, keep the campaign completion date on track, and save time by gathering all requirements early.



## Campaign Need Identification

Marketing listens closely to other business departments such as sales, to the customers, and trends happening throughout the world. One of these factors might cause someone in marketing to come up with a new campaign idea. Customers are complaining about a lack of onboarding process. Sales needs support to help qualify leads, or the messaging is inconsistent. Maybe there's a trend related to your industry that you wish to capitalize on. Whatever the reason is, it becomes the kernel for a new campaign. You identify the needs for a campaign that you wish to execute upon. If that campaign requires the use of the email channel, keep that idea in mind, and let's proceed to the next step.
