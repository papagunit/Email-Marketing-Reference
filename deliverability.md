What is Deliverability?

Why is Deliverability a subject within itself?

Because it directly affects performance, and contains so many proprietary and changing moving parts with an infinite combination of possible issues, deliverability is an important, deep and topic within email marketing, without many formally published specifications. It's a subject that few are experts on, and they capitalize on that scarcity of knowledge to charge substantial fees to marketers who must improve their performance at all costs.
